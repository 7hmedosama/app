# app

appstore project task 

I’d like to share a simple task I built using Flutter, where I implemented several core features that strengthen UI control and screen navigation inside the application.

Main features I used in the project:

 Splash Screen
A startup screen that appears before navigating to the Home Screen.

 InkWell
Used to handle tap interactions with clear visual feedback.

Navigator (push – pop)
Implemented navigation between screens (from the product list to the product details page and back).

 Arabic Language Support (RTL)
Adjusted the entire layout direction to Right-to-Left to properly support Arabic UI.

Decoration
Used BoxDecoration and general styling to format UI elements.

 EndDrawer + DrawerHeader
Created a right-side navigation drawer (EndDrawer) with a styled DrawerHeader for displaying a title or content.

ListView
Used ListView to display a list of products including:
Product Image
Product Name
Product Price
